### Project Summary: Customer Churn Analysis

### Objective: 
- The objective of this project is to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn.

### Data: 
- The data used for this project will come from various sources, including customer demographics, transaction history, and customer feedback.

### Methods:
- The project will employ a combination of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and build a predictive model. The algorithms considered for this project include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

### Outcome: 
- The outcome of this project will be a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn and provide insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn. The model will be tested and evaluated on a hold-out test set and its performance will be compared to other models.

### Impact: 
-The impact of this project will be to help the company understand why customers are leaving and to develop strategies to retain them. This will result in increased customer loyalty and reduced customer churn, leading to increased revenue and profitability for the company.
